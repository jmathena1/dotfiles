I'm currently using Vim's native package manager that's been available since Vim 8.
Previous commits to these repo used Vundle. I liked Vundle, I just don't have that many plugins and am trying to take more advantage of Vim's built-ins.

Anywho, my `.vim/pack` directory is currently organized into these folders:
- `airline/`
- `colors/`
- `plugins/`

And here are my current plugins:
- [mustang-vim](https://github.com/croaker/mustang-vim)
- [NERDtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)
- [SimpylFold](https://github.com/tmhedberg/SimpylFold)
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
- [vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes)
- [vim-flake8](https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8)
